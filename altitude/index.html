            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <p>
              Altitude Basketball is a club for girls in 3rd-8th grades in
              Colorado Springs, CO. This program was created in 2017 by, Monte
              Murdock, a father who wanted to give his young daughters a chance
              to grow and refine their basketball skills before heading into
              high school. Monte already had two older daughters in the Pine
              Creek High School Women’s Basketball Program, and saw the
              potential of starting a feeder program, not only his daughters but
              also the other girls who would eventually play on the same high
              school team. With a highly skilled sport like basketball starting
              early is often the key to success, and playing with the same group
              of girls for a long period of time helps the success of the team
              as a whole. So, the Pine Creek High School feeder program:
              Altitude Basketball, was born.

            <h1>Growth</h1>
            <p>
              As the program grew, and girls continued to hone and improve their
              skills, what started as a single team has become one of the
              largest programs in the city. In August of 2022, five years after
              its inception, Altitude Basketball boasts over 40 players, 8
              coaches, and 5 teams that regularly play in competitive leagues
              and tournaments in the Colorado Springs/Denver area.

            <h1>Multi-Sport Athletes</h1>
            <p>
              One of the most unique aspects of Altitude Basketball is that
              instead of requiring or even recommending that players stop
              playing other sports and focus solely on basketball, we encourage
              our players to play in multiple sports. Michelle Smith, a
              espnW.com Contributor, wrote a piece in 2016 highlighting the
              benefits of being a multi-sport athlete where she mentioned that
              for multi-sport athletes, there were fewer overuse injuries, less
              opportunity for emotional burn-out, and several other reason to
              continue playing multiple sports. She said, “Studies show that
              playing multiple sports leads to better muscle, motor and skill
              development. It promotes general athleticism, balance, speed, and
              agility.” link As a club we try to keep games to Saturdays
              whenever possible so that Sundays can be set aside for other
              sports, or family obligations.

            <h1>Run By Volunteers</h1>
            <p>
              Another unique part of Altitude Basketball is that it is run
              entirely by volunteers. Our owner, administrator, and coaches are
              all volunteers who love basketball, and want to help bring it to
              the next generation of players. This keeps the fees for the club
              relatively low compared to other for-profit organizations in the
              area. We will continue to grow and learn, as players, coaches and
              as an organization. If you want to join us click here!
