              Altitude Basketball is a club for girls in 3rd-8th grades in
              Colorado Springs, CO. This program was created in 2017 by, Monte
              Murdock, a father who wanted to give his young daughters a chance
              to grow and refine their basketball skills before heading into
              high school. Monte already had two older daughters in the Pine
              Creek High School Women’s Basketball Program, and saw the
              potential of starting a feeder program, not only his daughters but
              also the other girls who would eventually play on the same high
              school team. With a highly skilled sport like basketball starting
              early is often the key to success, and playing with the same group
              of girls for a long period of time helps the success of the team
              as a whole. So, the Pine Creek High School feeder program:
              Altitude Basketball, was born.

              As the program grew, and girls continued to hone and improve their
              skills, what started as a single team has become one of the
              largest, and most successful programs in the city. As of August of
              2022, five years after its inception, Altitude Basketball boasts
              over 40 players, 8 coaches, and 5 teams that regularly play in
              competitive leagues and tournaments in the Colorado Springs/Denver
              area.

              One of the most unique aspects of Altitude Basketball is that
              instead of requiring or even recommending that players stop
              playing other sports and focus solely on basketball, we encourage
              our players to play in multiple sports. It has been proven that
              multi-sport athletes have fewer overuse injuries, less opportunity
              for emotional burn-out. Studies show that playing multiple sports
              leads to better muscle, motor and skill development. It promotes
              general athleticism, balance, speed, and agility. As a club we try
              to keep games to Saturdays whenever possible so that Sundays can
              be set aside for other sports, or religous and family obligations.

              Another unique part of Altitude Basketball is that it is run
              entirely by volunteers. Our owner, administrator, and coaches are
              all volunteers who love basketball, and want to help bring it to
              the next generation of players. This keeps the fees for the club
              relatively low compared to other organizations in the area. We
              will continue to grow and learn, as players, coaches and as an
              organization. If you want to join us click here!

              The Altitude Basketball program was formed in 2017 to accommodate
              multi-sport athletes who desired highly-competitive basketball
              without the cost and time commitment of many programs that require
              exclusivity and frequent out-of-state travel. Altitude coaches are
              dedicated volunteers with prior coaching or playing experience.
              Altitude generally practices twice a week in the evenings and
              participates in leagues and tournaments principally on Saturdays.
              Altitude Basketball has quickly become the premier girls’
              basketball program in Southern Colorado and serves as the
              principal feeder program for Pine Creek HS Women’s basketball.
