            All Altitude coaches are dedicated volunteers with prior coaching or
            playing experience, who work to help their players, and their team
            as a whole improve in the game of basketball. While each coach has
            their own unique methods and style, all coaches stay within our
            clubâ€™s coaching philosophy.

          <h1>Coaching Philosophy</h1>
          <ol>
            <li>
              We teach kids how to play basketball, not how to run plays. Set
              plays have their place but practicing them should be a VERY
              minimal part of club practice if at all. Perhaps 1 or 2 inbounds
              plays. Maybe one set piece, especially for the younger grades. In
              contrast, we teach the kids how to pass, cut, ball screen, back
              cut, move without the ball, spacing, off ball screens, ball fake,
              recognize passing lanes, and more generally how to play in a team
              environment.
            </li>
            <li>
              We teach kids what specific skills they can work on without the
              intent of perfecting individual skills in practice. Team oriented
              concepts should take precedent. It is appropriate to spend some
              time with a particular shooting or dribbling drill in practice.
              However, the goal of such a drill is to give kids ideas on what to
              work on in their own time. No player will ever become a good
              shooter or dribbler simply by the drills and repetition in
              practice. There isn't enough time. We strive to minimize time
              standing in a line, and the bulk of practice time is spent on
              concepts that kids cannot do on their own, i.e. offensive and
              defensive team concepts.
            </li>
            <li>
              We teach and praise defensive effort equally or more than offense.
              Every player can have a night where things don't go right
              offensively for whatever reason. Every player should be able to
              impact the game with their defensive skills and knowledge
              regardless of their offensive aptitude. Players should be taught
              man defense and different zone defensive concepts. Team defense,
              help-side, see the ball, see the man and defensive priorities are
              all important concepts. Defensive priorities are <br />A. Defend
              the lane <br />B. Defend the ball <br />C. Defend your man (or
              zone).
            </li>
            <li>
              Everyone shoots, everyone dribbles. We can and should teach kids
              "their spots" (where they are likely to make a shot) and coach
              situational dribbling (i.e. not everyone should be encouraged to
              bring the ball up against a press), but we do not tell a player
              not to shoot or not to dribble. If the player is on the team we
              will have enough confidence in them that we don't have to instruct
              them to "never shoot" or "never dribble".
            </li>
            <li>
              Sportsmanship and positivity. There is no tolerance for cliques,
              exclusionary treatment, personal criticisms, backbiting, gossipy
              or "mean girl" behavior. Coaches try to set the tone by
              complimenting and praising more than critiquing. We praise
              sportsmanship and positivity.
            </li>
