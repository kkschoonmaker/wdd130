          All Altitude coaches are dedicated volunteers with prior coaching or
          playing experience, who work to help their players, and their team as
          a whole improve in the game of basketball. While each coach has their
          own unique methods and style, all coaches stay within our clubâ€™s
          coaching philosophy.

        <ol id="philosophy_list">
          <li>
            We teach kids how to play basketball, not how to run plays. Set
            plays have their place but practicing them is a very minimal part of
            club practice. Perhaps one or two inbounds plays, and one set piece,
            especially for the younger grades. In contrast, we teach the kids
            how to pass, cut, ball screen, back cut, move without the ball,
            spacing, off ball screens, ball fake, recognize passing lanes, and
            more generally how to play in a team environment.
          </li>

          <li>
            We teach kids what specific skills they can work on without the
            intent of perfecting individual skills in practice. Team oriented
            concepts take precedence. We spend some time with a particular
            shooting or dribbling drill in practice. However, the goal of such a
            drill is to give kids ideas on what to work on in their own time. No
            player will ever become a good shooter or dribbler simply by the
            drills and repetition in practice. There isn't enough time. We
            strive to minimize time standing in a line, and the bulk of practice
            time is spent on concepts that kids cannot do on their own, i.e.
            offensive and defensive team concepts.
          </li>

          <li>
            We teach and praise defensive effort equally or more than offense.
            Every player can have a night where things don't go right
            offensively for whatever reason. Every player should be able to
            impact the game with their defensive skills and knowledge regardless
            of their offensive aptitude. Players should be taught man defense
            and different zone defensive concepts. Team defense, help-side, see
            the ball, see the man and defensive priorities are all important
            concepts. Defensive priorities are: <br />
            &emsp; A. Defend the lane <br />&emsp; B. Defend the ball
            <br />&emsp; C. Defend your man/zone
          </li>

          <li>
            Everyone shoots, everyone dribbles. We teach kids "their spots"
            (where they are likely to make a shot) and coach situational
            dribbling (i.e. not everyone should be encouraged to bring the ball
            up against a press), but we do not tell a player not to shoot or not
            to dribble. If the player is on the team we will have enough
            confidence in them that we don't have to instruct them to "never
            shoot" or "never dribble".
          </li>

          <li>
            Sportsmanship and positivity. There is no tolerance for cliques,
            exclusionary treatment, personal criticisms, backbiting, gossipy or
            "mean girl" behavior. Coaches try to set the tone by complimenting
            and praising more than critiquing. We praise sportsmanship and
            positivity.
