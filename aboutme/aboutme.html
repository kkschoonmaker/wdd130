    <h2>Kelly Schoonmaker</h2>
    <p>Hello all!</p>
    <p>My name is Kelly Schoonmaker, and I live in Colorado Springs with my husband, Jeremy and our four kids: Karli-13, Kaitlyn-10, Jakob-7, and Justin-4. Jeremy and I met in college at BYU Provo, lived in New Mexico for six years and then moved here to Colorado Springs in 2016.</p>
    <p>I am at BYU-I online to finish my degree; I am majoring in Applied Technology with certificates in front end web design, and graphic design. I love to create things. I love to design and create digital compositions, I like to sew and quilt, and I am a woodworker and I like to build things and remodel my home.</p>
    <p>I also have very busy kids who are involved in multiple sports (tae kwondo, soccer, basketball, baseball, softball, cross country, jump rope, and track to name a few lol) and I am lucky enough to get to coach a couple of them on their different teams. My oldest three each play an instrument (flute, piano, and guitar) and we love to sing together as a family around the piano.</p>
